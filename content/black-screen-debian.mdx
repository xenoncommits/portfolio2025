# How I Fixed the Black Screen Issue in KDE Plasma

![Black Screen](/black-screen.avif)

Today, I went to my friend's house and he was using KDE Plasma. He was like "oh, I'm gonna try it", and suddenly we got a black screen issue, glad that I faced this issue earlier and fixed it too, so the above image is an old imgage but the method is same, here we go - 

## Temporary Fix

- Yeah, that old school method, **restart the system**, if it worked then fine, but if it didn't, then we need to go for the next method.

- Press **`Ctrl + Alt + T`** to open the terminal.
- If you can see the mouse cursor but not the desktop, it usually means that **Plasma (plasmashell) has crashed**.
- Type this command and presss enter - 

```bash
systemctl --user restart plasma-plasmashell.service
```
- This restarts Plasma, and your desktop should come back to life (I hope)

## Permanent Fix

- To stop this from happening again, you’ll need to update your system. Outdated or broken packages can often cause Plasma to crash.

-First, turn on **offline updates** in your Software Update settings.
![Offline Updates](/debian.avif)
- This ensures updates are applied safely during a restart.
- Then run these commands - 

```bash 
sudo apt dist-upgrade
sudo apt install -f
```

- The first command updates all packages (and their dependencies) to the latest version.
- The second command fixes any broken dependencies that might be causing trouble.
- After doing this, I haven’t faced the black screen issue again.

## Final Thoughts

- If you use KDE Plasma and suddenly end up staring at a black screen with only your cursor, don’t panic. 
- A quick restart of plasmashell should bring things back, and keeping your system updated will help prevent it in the future.

- Btw, I posted it a long time ago, but I didn't get any response on twitter, here it is btw -
